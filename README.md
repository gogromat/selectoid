Selectoid
=========

Selectoid is a JavaScript select box plugin.

Project Dependencies:
---
 - ```jquery```

The idea is nothing new: its an attempt to make a user-friendly select box.

However Selectoid was specifically made to look like 
a tabular data rather than a dropdwon menu like most other select box plugins.

Inspiration
---
Selectoid was inspired by Google Translator's Select Box.
Google's Select Box is a great example on how beautiful HTML/forn elements can be/become.


Below you can compare the looks of both Selectoid Select Box and Google Translate's Select Box.

Contribution
---
Feel free to contribute to the project! Selectoid is a pretty raw select box.
There was no cross-browser fine-tuning and no major testing is done.
