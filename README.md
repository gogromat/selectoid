Selectoid
=========

Selectoid is a JavaScript select box plugin.

The idea is nothing new: its an attempt to make a user-friendly select box.

However Selectoid is specifically make to make select box to look similar to a table data.

Selectoid was inspired by Google Translator's Select Box.

Below are the images to compare the two select boxes.
