Selectoid
=========

Selectoid is a JavaScript select box plugin.

Dependencies:

 - underscore.js
 - jquery

The idea is nothing new: its an attempt to make a user-friendly select box.

However Selectoid was specifically made to look like 
a tabular data rather than a dropdwon menu like most other select box plugins.

Selectoid was inspired by Google Translator's Select Box.

Below are the images to compare the two select boxes.
